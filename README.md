# Hyperskill_Steganography_and_Cryptography
Difficulty: Medium

## About
You can use encryption to send secret messages, but if you want to be even more subtle, you can hide them in plain sight: in an image. 
This kind of encryption is called steganography. The message will be hiding in a picture on some web site, and only those who know will understand it. 
For maximum security, the message itself can be encrypted, as well.
## Learning outcomes
While creating a program for encrypting and concealing a message within an image, you will learn about files, image handling, arrays, and logical functions. 
In addition, you will learn basic yet strong encryption.

# Project stages
## Stage 1/4: Program interface
Learn how to work with string input and output: create a simple user interface to let the user input commands to the program.
## Stage 2/4: Read and Write image files
Learn how to read image files, handle image data, and save images.
## Stage 3/4: Hide a message in an image
Learn how to hide information within images by slightly changing the pixels' colors and then retrieve this information. 
There will be no obvious change in the image, so no-one will know that it's keeping some secrets.
## Stage 4/4: Encrypt the message
Learn a simple yet effective encryption scheme and see how to make it strong and hard to crack.
